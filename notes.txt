Props/properties are arguments that are passed into components via attributes 
- They can be used to customize the component's behavior and appearance.
- They are used to pass data from the parent component to the child component.
Example code

// creating the props

const Person = (props) => {
..
..
<h1>Name: {props.name}</h1>
}
..

// assigning the prop
const App = ()  => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* injecting a component into a component */}
      <Person name={John} />
    </div>
  );
}
